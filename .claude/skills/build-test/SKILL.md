description: Build the Unreal editor and run automation tests via UnrealToolbox (CkAuto). Use after writing C++ or AngelScript code in any project with a CkAuto/ folder to compile and verify it — never invoke Build.bat, UnrealBuildTool, or UnrealEditor-Cmd directly. Also covers process-level Gauntlet test runs (--gauntlet).

# Build & Test (Unreal Toolbox)

Compile the project's editor and run automation tests via UnrealToolbox to verify the C++ / Angelscript code you just wrote.

## Toolbox

Every CK-family project ships UnrealToolbox at `<project-root>/CkAuto/UnrealToolbox.exe`. Always invoke via the project-relative path so this skill works across any project that has the standard `CkAuto/` folder.

The toolbox handles engine resolution, plugin paths, and the UBT / automation invocation. **Do not** try to find UnrealBuildTool, the engine root, or the editor binary yourself — the whole point of the toolbox is that the agent shouldn't pick the wrong engine.

## Default flow: one single-shot invocation

The default is a **single** `--build --test` invocation writing **one** log (`Saved/Logs/BuildTest.log`). This is deliberate: the toolbox pops one LogViewer progress window at build start and reuses it through the test phase, so you watch the **entire** process — build → editor boot → tests — in one continuous window, with the build lines auto-colored as `msbuild` and the editor lines as `unreal` (segmented parsing). Two separate invocations would pop two sequential windows and split the log in two; use the [Separate-logs variant](#separate-logs-variant-two-invocations) below only when you specifically want the two logs apart.

## Decide: build path or test-only path

**What changed since the editor last built determines whether you need to close the editor at all.**

- **C++ changed** (`.h`/`.cpp`, `*.Build.cs`, `*.uplugin`, or top-level source layout) → **build path**: single-shot `--build --test`, and the editor **must be closed** (the pre-flight table below enforces this). Building while the editor holds its module DLLs corrupts hot-reload state, and two editors fight over `Saved/`/`Intermediate/`.
- **AngelScript / content only** (`.as`, `.uasset`, config — no C++) → **test-only path**: a standalone `--test` invocation that can run **while your editor stays open**, under the quiescence protocol below. There is nothing to rebuild — the toolbox spawns its own headless editor to run the tests, and (verified) that coexists with your open editor as long as no script/source files change during the run. For *iterative* test runs (running `--test` repeatedly), **pre-warm a resident test editor once** and route runs into it to skip the ~45s per-run boot — see [Warm server](#warm-server-zero-boot-iteration) below.

If you're unsure whether your edits count as "C++ changed," treat it as the build path — a needless rebuild is cheap; skipping a needed one runs tests against stale code.

> **Note on `--config` for the test-only path:** `--config` is a `->needs(--build)` sub-flag, so a standalone `--test` ignores it and runs whatever config is already built (Development by default). That's expected — you're not rebuilding.

## Pre-flight: editor coexistence decision table

The toolbox spawns its own editor. Whether a *different* editor already open on this project is a problem depends on what you're running:

| Invocation | Another editor open? | Action |
|---|---|---|
| any `--build` (incl. `--build --test` / `--build --gauntlet`) | yes | **Wait for it to close** — build + editor DLL/hot-reload contention is real (probe + wait loop below) |
| standalone `--test` | yes | **Proceed with the editor open** — follow the quiescence protocol below |
| standalone single `--gauntlet <Test>` | yes | Proceed under the same protocol (each run is a fresh `-game` boot) |
| `--gauntlet all` | yes | **Prefer waiting** — the ~25 min run makes a mid-run script edit far more likely |
| anything | no | proceed |

Detection is the same in every row — the active editor holds an exclusive write lock on `<session-project-root>/Saved/Logs/<ProjectName>.log` (where `<ProjectName>` matches the `.uproject` filename — e.g. `BusterBlock.log`). Probe it:

```powershell
try { [IO.File]::Open('<session-project-root>/Saved/Logs/<ProjectName>.log', 'Open', 'Write', 'None').Close(); 'free' } catch { 'locked' }
```

**When the table says "wait"** (`'locked'` and you're on a build path): do not kill the process, do not stomp the lock. Use a background loop so the wait is event-driven and you get a completion notification when it's free:

```bash
until ! powershell -NoProfile -Command "try { [IO.File]::Open('<session-project-root>/Saved/Logs/<ProjectName>.log', 'Open', 'Write', 'None').Close(); exit 0 } catch { exit 1 }"; do echo "$(date -u +%H:%M:%S) editor still up, sleeping 60s..."; sleep 60; done
```

Run that in the background with a generous timeout (10+ min). Don't poll yourself — wait for the completion notification, then proceed.

**Caveat:** if YOU are holding the lock from a still-running prior toolbox invocation that you started, the wait will never return — close that toolbox/editor first. The wait pattern is for *other* sessions or stale processes.

### Quiescence protocol (test-only path, editor open)

The one hazard of running `--test` beside your open editor: if any AngelScript/source file changes *during* the run, your live editor hot-reloads and rewrites `Script/Generated/*` mid-run; the toolbox's headless editor can't full-reload, logs `Full Reload is required ... keeping old script code`, and that Error is attributed to whatever test is running → spurious failures/timeouts. The protocol removes that hazard:

1. **Pre-check that the live editor has settled.** Probe the tail of the live log:
   ```powershell
   Select-String -Path "<session-project-root>\Saved\Logs\<ProjectName>.log" -Pattern "==script reload total==|Full Reload is required" | Select-Object -Last 5
   ```
   If the most recent hit is a `Full Reload is required` line (a pending deferred regen), **don't start** — ask the user to focus the editor so the regen completes, then re-probe. If the last line is an old `==script reload total==` with nothing after it, proceed.
2. **Freeze edits for the duration.** From toolbox launch until the completion notification: make **no** edits to `.as` / `.h` / `.cpp` (anything that triggers script regen), and print a user-facing warning in chat:
   > "Running tests beside your open editor — please don't save AngelScript/source edits until it completes (~N min), or the run may report false failures."

   Also caution (there's no cheap way to probe it): if you have the **AutoTests map open and dirty** in your editor, the headless run's populator auto-save can conflict — save or close that map first.
3. **Red-run forensics.** If the run comes back red *and* it ran beside a live editor, before trusting any failure:
   ```powershell
   Select-String -Path "Saved\Logs\Test-Editor.log" -Pattern "Full Reload is required"
   ```
   (Use `BuildTest.log` for the single-shot form.) Any hit → the run is **contaminated, not failed**: re-run the failed subset after the editor is quiescent instead of debugging the failures. Likewise, a *cluster* of settle-timer flakes beside a live editor is machine-contention contamination — same remedy.

> **Toolbox v1.19+** prints its own `LIVE EDITOR DETECTED` advisory, adds a `Contaminated: N` summary line, exits `78` when only contamination remains (no real failures), and auto-retries contaminated tests once — so step 3's manual grep becomes a fallback for older toolbox versions. Exit `77` means a `--build` was refused because an editor is open (pass `--allow-live-editor` to override, or `--no-wait` to fail fast instead of waiting). (Exit `76` is the pre-existing "test boot's own AngelScript failed to compile, ran stale bytecode" code — unrelated to a live editor.)

## Procedure

### Phase 1: Confirm config

If the user's request includes a config keyword, use it. Otherwise ask:

> "Which editor configuration — DebugGame Editor or Development Editor?"

| User says | Flag |
|---|---|
| `dev` / `development` | `--config=Development` |
| `debug` / `debuggame` | `--config=DebugGame` |

If unsure, default to **DebugGame** for code-fix iteration (faster link, debuggable symbols).

### Phase 2: Decide what to test

Single-shot needs the test pattern up front (both phases run in one command). Determine it in this order:

1. If the user passed a non-config token (e.g. `/build-test debug Goap`), use it verbatim.
2. Otherwise infer from your own recent edits: look at which Plugins / Source modules you touched. The substring of the module name is enough — `CkGoap` → `Goap`, `CkInventory` → `Inventory`.
3. If you can't infer, ask the user: "Test pattern? (e.g. `Goap`, `Inventory`, or `all`)".
4. For `all`, omit `--test-pattern` entirely so every project test runs.

**The matcher is forgiving**: case-insensitive substring tokens, any order. `Goap`, `cktests.GOAP`, and `goap.basicplan` all work. You don't need the full dotted test path.

### Phase 3: Build + test (single-shot)

**First consult the Pre-flight decision table** (see above) — once, before this invocation. The single-shot `--build --test` is a build path, so it needs the editor closed; for an AS/content-only change prefer the standalone `--test` (Separate-logs variant) which can run with the editor open.

Run in the **background** — a CK-family editor build is 5-30 minutes. Use a 600000 ms (10 min) timeout, then await the completion notification. **Do not poll the log.**

The project root is the **primary working directory of the current session** — whatever repo Claude Code was launched from. However, if the changed files live in a *different* project (e.g. work was done in a sibling repo like BusterBlock while the session root is CkPlugins), build that project instead. Always `Set-Location` to the project being built explicitly before invoking the toolbox so the relative `./CkAuto/` and `--project=` paths resolve correctly.

```powershell
Set-Location "<session-project-root>"; ./CkAuto/UnrealToolbox.exe --build --config=<Configuration> --target=Editor --test --test-pattern <Pattern> --output=Saved/Logs/BuildTest.log --project="<session-project-root>"
```

(Drop `--test-pattern` for the `all` case.) The test phase only runs if the build succeeded.

**Do NOT** pass `--generate` for normal iteration — it forces a project-files regeneration that adds time for no benefit. Use it only when a `*.Build.cs`, `*.uplugin`, or top-level source layout has changed since the previous build.

One progress LogViewer window opens at build start and is reused through the test phase (toolbox v1.15+), so the user watches build → editor boot → tests in a single window. Nothing to launch or wire — it's default-on whenever `--output` is set. On a true-headless / no-desktop machine (CI), add `--no-progress-window`.

### Phase 4: Report

Everything is in `Saved/Logs/BuildTest.log` — build output first, then the editor/test output.

- **Build failed** (non-zero exit with no `=== Test summary ===` block) → find the compile/link errors and stop; do not report test results that don't exist:
  ```powershell
  Select-String -Path "Saved\Logs\BuildTest.log" -Pattern "error C\d+|fatal error|LNK\d+|: error |^Error" | Select-Object -First 40
  ```
  Build logs run 50K+ lines — do **not** read the whole file.
- **Build succeeded** → read the **summary block** near the end:
  ```
  === Test summary ===
  Total: 2
  Passed: 2
  Failed: 0
  Skipped: 0
  Duration: 55s
  ```
  - **Exit 0** → green. Report ✅ `N passed` plus the duration.
  - **Non-zero with `Failed > 0`** → real test failures. Pull per-test details:
    ```powershell
    Select-String -Path "Saved\Logs\BuildTest.log" -Pattern "TestResult=Failed|FinishTest TestResult=Failed"
    ```
    Each match has the test name + the assertion message from the test author. Report those verbatim — they are the structured failure output.

## Traps to avoid

These bit before and the toolbox docs don't all flag them:

- **Non-zero exit from `--test` is the normal way the toolbox reports test failures.** It is *not* a toolbox bug. Read the summary block to know what actually happened.
- **Don't grep the log for `Display:` lines first.** Test outcomes live in `LogAutomationController` lines (`Test Started`, `Test Completed. Result={…}`) and the trailing summary block. Anything else is noise.
- **Don't try to resolve the engine path.** If a build or test fails with "Plugin X failed to load" / "could not find module", that's an engine-selection problem — escalate to the user, do not hunt down DLLs yourself.
- **Don't poll background tasks.** You are notified on completion. Polling reads partial flushes and gives misleading state.
- **Don't time out aggressively.** 5-30 min is normal for a CK editor build. 10 min is the floor; raise it if you've seen this project run longer historically.
- **Angelscript bindings regenerate on editor startup** — and `--test` spins up the editor — so if your C++ change exposed a new API and your AS callsites use it, the test phase exercising the AS path implicitly verifies the AS regeneration too.
- **Do not commit `Saved/Logs/BuildTest.log`** (or the `Build-Editor.log` / `Test-Editor.log` of the separate-logs variant). They're scratch output. The standard `Saved/` is gitignored at the project root, but double-check if you ever stage selectively.
- **Don't edit AngelScript/source during a test-only run beside a live editor.** A saved `.as` edit makes the live editor rewrite `Script/Generated/*` mid-run and the headless test editor logs `Full Reload is required` — grep for that phrase before trusting a red run (see the Quiescence protocol). Freeze edits until the completion notification.
- **Exit `77`/`78` from toolbox v1.19+ are not test failures.** `77` = a `--build` was refused because an editor is open; `78` = the run was inconclusive because a live editor contaminated it (`Contaminated: N` in the summary), with no genuine failures. Neither means a real test failed. (`76` is the older "AngelScript failed to compile in the test boot itself" code — also not a test failure.)

## Gauntlet variant (process-level tests)

Projects that ship a `GauntletTests.json` at the project root (BusterBlock does) can run process-level Gauntlet tests through the same toolbox (v1.12+). The Pre-flight decision table applies — a single `--gauntlet <Test>` boots the project's editor binary in `-game` mode and can run with your editor open (quiescence protocol), but `--build --gauntlet` needs the editor closed and `--gauntlet all` prefers waiting (its ~25 min run widens the mid-run-edit window). Compose it single-shot with `--build` so build → gauntlet share one window and one log, same as the default flow above.

```powershell
Set-Location "<session-project-root>"; ./CkAuto/UnrealToolbox.exe --build --config=<Configuration> --target=Editor --gauntlet <TestName|all> --output=Saved/Logs/Gauntlet-Editor.log --project="<session-project-root>"
```

- Drop `--build` to run against the already-built editor.
- `--gauntlet-repeat N` = flake mode; `--gauntlet-include-xfail` = also run expected-FAIL tests;
  `--gauntlet-map /Game/...` = map override.
- `--gauntlet-visual` (v1.16+) = run in a real rendered window (drops `-nullrhi`/`-nosound`, adds
  `-windowed 1280x720`) so a human can watch the test play out. Watchdogs are DISABLED for the
  run (a paused/inspected editor must not be killed) — the run holds the machine-wide build lock
  until it ends, so don't leave a visual run sitting unattended. For human observation, not CI.
  The interactive TUI also has a Gauntlet tab (v1.16+): browse/mark manifest tests, `r` run menu
  incl. a persisted visual-mode toggle.
- Each run's FULL editor log is archived under `Saved/Logs/Gauntlet/<timestamp>/<Test>_rN.log`;
  the `--output` log gets only heartbeats + verdicts + the `=== Gauntlet summary ===` block.
- Verdicts: `PASS`/`FAIL`/`TEST_TIMEOUT` (bridge watchdog)/`AS_COMPILE_HANG`/`EDITOR_STALL`
  (toolbox watchdogs)/`AS_CLASS_MISSING` (exit 4 — AS compile failure)/`HARNESS_MISCONFIG`/`CRASH`
  (NTSTATUS hex)/`INCONCLUSIVE` (exit 0 without the completion line — NOT a pass).
- Budget ~60-90s per test (fresh editor boot each); `all` on BusterBlock is ~25 min.

## Separate-logs variant (two invocations)

Use this when you specifically want the build and test output in separate files — e.g. to grep them independently, or to iterate on tests without rebuilding while keeping the build log around. **This is also the form the test-only path uses** — the standalone `--test` invocation below is exactly what you run (editor open, under the quiescence protocol) for an AS/content-only change. It runs build and test as two separate invocations, each with its own `--output` and its own pre-flight decision:

```powershell
Set-Location "<session-project-root>"; ./CkAuto/UnrealToolbox.exe --build --config=<Configuration> --target=Editor --output=Saved/Logs/Build-Editor.log --project="<session-project-root>"
# then, only if the build succeeded:
Set-Location "<session-project-root>"; ./CkAuto/UnrealToolbox.exe --test --test-pattern <Pattern> --output=Saved/Logs/Test-Editor.log --project="<session-project-root>"
```

**Cost:** this pops **two sequential** progress windows — the test invocation closes the build's window and opens its own, so you never see the whole run in one continuous view. Prefer the single-shot default above unless the separate files earn their keep.

## Warm server (zero-boot iteration)

**Toolbox v1.20+.** Every `--test` normally boots a fresh headless editor (~45s) and tears it down. When you're iterating — running the test-only path repeatedly on the same AS/content — you can pay that boot **once** by keeping a resident **warm server**: a headless `-CkTestBridgeServe` editor that serves test runs over a file-drop bridge (the CkTestsBridge module). It coexists with your own open editor (headless, `-nullrhi`, and it declines AngelScript-regen ownership so your editor stays primary for codegen).

**Pre-warm the moment you start writing tests**, so the boot overlaps your edit time. As an agent, pass `--no-progress-window` — v1.22+ otherwise opens a LogViewer window on the user's desktop (that window is for a *human* running this by hand, not for you):

```powershell
Set-Location "<session-project-root>"; ./CkAuto/UnrealToolbox.exe --warm-server start --no-progress-window --project="<session-project-root>"
```

`start` is **idempotent** (a no-op if one is already serving) and blocks until the server arms (~60s cold) or times out. Then route runs into it with `--live` — no boot:

```powershell
Set-Location "<session-project-root>"; ./CkAuto/UnrealToolbox.exe --test --live --no-progress-window --test-pattern <Pattern> --output=Saved/Logs/Test-Editor.log --project="<session-project-root>"
```

- **`--live`** routes into the warm server (or *launches* one if none is serving, then routes — falling back to a fresh boot only if it can't come up). `--no-live` forces today's fresh-boot path.
- **`--warm-server status`** prints the serving pid / idle-or-busy (exit 0 serving, 1 none); **`--warm-server stop`** terminates an idle server. The server also self-quits after ~15 min idle or a ~2 h wall-clock cap, so a forgotten one cleans itself up.
- **Window (v1.22+, humans only):** run interactively *without* `--no-progress-window` and `--warm-server start` opens ONE LogViewer for the server's whole life — boot → idle → the test progress of routed `--live` runs (they execute inside it) → idle — closed by `--warm-server stop`. A live run reuses that window rather than popping a second. As an agent, always pass `--no-progress-window` (above) so nothing pops on the user's desktop.
- **Fidelity:** live/warm results are for **iteration**. Because state accumulates across runs in a long-lived editor, a **fresh boot** (`--no-live`, or the clean `--build --test` build path) stays the **gate of record** for any "done" / "no regressions" claim. Re-run `--no-live` before reporting.
- The warm server is protected from a concurrent `--build` by the same editor-open gate (`--build` waits / exits 77 while it's running) — so don't try to `--build` while a warm server is up; `--warm-server stop` it first.

## Arguments

Arguments may combine a config keyword (`dev`/`debug`) and/or a test pattern, in any order — e.g. `/build-test debug Goap`. Missing pieces follow the Phase 1 / Phase 2 resolution rules above.
