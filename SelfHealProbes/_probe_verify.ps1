.SYNOPSIS
    Verifies AS self-heal integration probe outcomes by grepping the editor
    log for expected dispatcher events.

.DESCRIPTION
    Project-agnostic: project name and root are resolved from script
    location ($PSScriptRoot/../..). Expected event lists are built dynamically
    from sidecar files (where applicable) so events for skipped strategies
    are dropped automatically.

    Exit codes:
      0 — all events matched (PROBE PASSED)
      1 — at least one event missing (PROBE FAILED)
      2 — missing args / sidecar / log / project root (usage error)

.PARAMETER Probe
    Which probe to verify:
      merge_conflict      — cold-start bootstrap drain (multi-strategy)
      mid_session_add     — mid-session ticker drain (multi-strategy)
      tier3               — Tier 3 refusal banner (no sidecar — fixed events)
      assetregistry_loop  — verifies AR-sibling deletion happens AFTER the
                            regen ticker rewrites the canonical (post-fix)
                            rather than BEFORE (pre-fix). See the Probe C
                            row in README.md.
      blockingload_class_synth — verifies the synthesizer classifies
                            `assets::load::<X>_Class()` as BlockingLoadClass
                            (strips `_Class` for disk lookup, emits a
                            TSubclassOf<X> stub that compiles). See the
                            Probe D row in README.md.
      wbp_class_synth     — verifies the Tier 2.5 AssetData
                            NativeParentClass tag fallback resolves WBP
                            `_Class` accessors whose ParentClass is an
                            AS-defined UClass (LoadObject can't construct
                            those at modal-tick). See the Probe E row in
                            README.md.

.PARAMETER LogPath
    Optional explicit log path. If omitted, the newest
    Saved/Logs/<ProjectName>*.log by LastWriteTime is used. Useful when the
    editor was launched with -ABSLOG=<custom>.

.PARAMETER Tail
    Live-tail mode: scan existing log content for already-fired events, then
    follow the log file for new lines and match the remaining events as they
    arrive. Useful for "launch editor, run verifier in another shell, watch
    recovery unfold". Exits when all events match or you Ctrl+C.

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh _probe_verify.ps1 merge_conflict
    pwsh _probe_verify.ps1 mid_session_add -LogPath Saved/Logs/probe_b.log
    pwsh _probe_verify.ps1 tier3
    pwsh _probe_verify.ps1 mid_session_add -Tail
